### [1] Setting up Environment:
1. Download `Python`
2. Download `Anaconda`
3. Lunch `Jupyter`

### [2] The Basics of Image Processing:
- File formats.
- Resolutions.
- Matrix of Pixles.
- Color or grayscale.
> Check [Ch02](../Computer%20vision/Excersises/Ch02)

### [3] From Color to Black and White:
- Convert color image to grayscalse.
- Convert grayscale to black and white.
> Check [Ch03](../Computer%20vision/Excersises/Ch03)

### [4] Filters:
- Convolution Filters.
- Edges pixels.
- Convolution Filters take long to compute and are highly parallizable.
