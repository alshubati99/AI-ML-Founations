# Deep Learning Foundations: Natural Language Processing with TensorFlow.
# [*course Certificate*]()

### [1] Getting Started with NLP:
- NLP: area of CS and AI that enables the interaction of computers with humans through natural language.
- Applicaions: 
    - Speech recognition.
    - Sentiment analysis.
    - Text summarization.
    - Machine translation and text generation.
- Understading Text: 
    - Syntactical Analysis: Grammar.
    - Semantic Analysis: Meaning
- Techniques in NLPs:
    - Parsing: formal analysis of a sentence. 
    - Stemming: reducing words to their stems.  
    - Text segmentaion: transforming text into meaningful components like words, intentions and sentiment. 
- Deep Learning for NLP. 
- Charachters Encoding: 
    - Problems: 
        - words with different meanings but have same letters so they have same ASCII code.

### [2] Text Classification:
### [3] Classification with RNNs and LSTMs:
- RNN: Recurrent Neural Network.
- LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory
### [4] Text Generation with RNNs:
- Prediction problem rather thatn classification. 
1. Create a corpus- break down the text down to list of sentences.
2. Create a word index vocabulary form the text. 
3. Tokenize the data and create an n-gram sequence for each sequence of the corpus.
4. Pad those sequences.
5. Segregate features from the sequences by reserving the last element of the arrays as labels.
