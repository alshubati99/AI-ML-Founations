# [*Course Certificate*](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/certificates/a4011a7120803f38d0ca32b12937315077493f5f3985be0743252e8c934e1f3c)

### What is AI:
- Computer and Human intelligence are different. 
- Computers could play games. 
- Patter matching like in Google. 
- History of AI: 
    - Ambitions and self diciplane 1956 first attempt to create AI. => Problem solvers. 
    - Symbols are the root of AI. 
    - The key part of human reasoning is connecting symbols.
    - Chinese Room Argument => matching patterns.
    - Combinatorial Explosion. 
- Strong vs. Weak AI: 
    - Strong AI => General AI might learn a lanuage. 
    - Weak AI => very narrow. 
    - Apple serie => weak AI, pattern matching. 
    - Symolic System Approach.
    - Expert Systems: Combinatorial Explosion. 
- Plan AI: 
    - Tryies to solve a problem of a long patterns matching called *Heuristic Reasoning*. 
    - With naviagation systems like GoogleMaps. 
    - Planning AI uses Heuristic. 
    - Mostly old fashioned AI.
### The rise of Machine Learning:
- Machine Learning:
    - Started 1959. 
    - Wasn't like an expert system.
    - Programs. 
    - Machine can continue to learn. 
    - ML helps identify patterns. 
- Artificial Neural Networks: 
    - ANN is a computer program that mimics the human brain. 
    - Challenge = Time consuming. 
    - It could train itself to understand the input. 
- Perceptrons:  
    - 1980s and 90s, Perceptrons = Mark1 Perceptrons => designed to tell difference between 2 different images. 
    - 1990s => Deep Learning => more layers and new teckniques such as Back Propagation. 
    - Clustering: allows the Deaplearnign network to group the patterns and help network identify the image.   
### Finding the Right Approach:
- *Match Patterns*: 
    - Machine Learning surpasses Symbolic Reasoning. 
    - Yahoo was like an expert system.
    - Web and AI in Google.
    - Data and computations are mixed together. 
- *Data vs. Reasoning*: 
    - Symbolic reasoning = Abstract Problem but know steps. 
    - Machine Learning: Look for patterns. 
    - Key Attributes. 
    - Deep Learning. 
- *Unsupervised Learning*: 
    - Supervised Learning: Give data called a Trained Set. 
    - Unsupervised  Learning: Feed all data, then ask the algorithm to create its categories by itself. 
    - Advantages: much more accurate. 
    - Disadvantage: some categories might be different from humans.
- *Backpropagation*: 
    - Is a way to deal with errors correction. 
    - Only used for supervised learning. 
    - Supervised learning can be used for classification. 
- *Regression*: 
    - Supervised Learning technique. 
    - Accruate Prediction. 
    - Dependent Variables (DV).
    - Independent Variables (IV).
> Classification: Sorting <br> 
> Regression: Connecting. 
### Common AI Programs:
- *Robotics*:
    - Having machines to work on physical tasks. 
    - Intelligent House Cleaning Vaccume. (Roomba)
    - Autonmous Cars => Backpropagation.  
- *Natural Language Processing*: 
    - Communicating. 
    - Too easy to have two machines communicate. 
    - Interact with machine using human language. 
    - It is about understanding the context behind words. 
- *The Internet of Things*: 
    - (IoT) massive new source of data. 
    - Embeding small devices to machine. 
    - Creates more data for machine to deal with. 
    - IoT medical Devices => use unsupervised ML or DeepLearning Neural Networks. 
- *Big Data*:
    - Big data = way to describe a particular problem. 
    - Collecting more data and intrepet it. 
    - Big data is a driver for ML.
    - Data Mining is a broad term. 
    - Machine Learning: requires training and frameworks.
    - Data Mining: uses broader tools without required training.
    - Large Data Sets. 
- *Data Science*:
    - Programming, math, statistics, hacking. 
    - Why to see patterns. 
### Avoiding Pitfalls:
- AI WINTERS. 
- Use ML to fined patterns. 
- General Problem Solver.
